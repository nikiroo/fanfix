Compatibility bug
	Again... because of some useless imports made there for a wrong jDoc
	comment

Version 0.9.3
-------------

Compatibility bug
	The library did not work with JDK versions prior to 1.8 because
	of a dependency on Base64
	A new (public domain) class was used instead, which is compatible with
	Java 1.5 this time

Version 0.9.2
-------------

Initial version
	...on GIT
