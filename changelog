Version 1.3.1
-------------

New Version class
	Which can parse versions from the running program

Version 1.2.3
-------------

Add openResource and getVersion in IOUtils
	The file VERSION is supposed to exist

Give more informartion on AssertErrors
	The TestCase were not always helpful in case of AssertExceptions; they
	now print the stacktrace (they only used to do it for non-assert
	exceptions)

Fix configure.sh
	The VERSION file was not added, the Main method was not the correct
	one (so it was not producing working runnable JAR, yet it stated so)

Version 1.2.2
-------------

Fix bug in Bundle regarding \t handling
	...tests should be written (later)

Version 1.2.1
-------------

New drawEllipse3D method
	...in UIUtils

Version 1.1.1
-------------

Add UI component for Progress
	Still a WIP, it only show the current progress bar, still not the
	children bars (it's planned)

Version 1.1.0
-------------

Add progress reporting, move to ui package
	A new progress reporting system (and tests) in the new ui package
	(some other classes have been moved into ui, too: WrapLayout and
	UIUtils)

Version 1.0.0
-------------

Add WrapLayout and UIUtils
	A FlowLayout that automatically wrap to the next line (from existing
	code found on internet) and a method to set a fake-native look & feel

Version 0.9.7
-------------

Improve toImage and allow non-resetable InputStreams
	...though they are then automatically saved onto disk then re-opened,
	then the file is deleted at the end of the process -- bad perfs
	Worse, it does it even if no EXIF metadata are present (because it
	cannot know that before reading the Stream, and cannot save a
	partially, non-resetable Stream to disk)

Reoarganize some methods from String to IO

Version 0.9.6
-------------

New test system
	Now some unit tests have been added, as well as the support classes

Version 0.9.5
-------------

Resource bundle bug
	UTF-8 strings were sometimes wrangled
	It is fixed by using a Bundle#Control, whih sadly is only available in
	Java 1.6+

Version 0.9.4
-------------

Compatibility bug
	Again... because of some useless imports made there for a wrong jDoc
	comment

Version 0.9.3
-------------

Compatibility bug
	The library did not work with JDK versions prior to 1.8 because
	of a dependency on Base64
	A new (public domain) class was used instead, which is compatible with
	Java 1.5 this time

Version 0.9.2
-------------

Initial version
	...on GIT
