Version 0.9.6
-------------

New test system
	Now some unit tests have been added, as well as the support classes

Version 0.9.5
-------------

Resource bundle bug
	UTF-8 strings were sometimes wrangled
	It is fixed by using a Bundle#Control, whih sadly is only available in
	Java 1.6+

Version 0.9.4
-------------

Compatibility bug
	Again... because of some useless imports made there for a wrong jDoc
	comment

Version 0.9.3
-------------

Compatibility bug
	The library did not work with JDK versions prior to 1.8 because
	of a dependency on Base64
	A new (public domain) class was used instead, which is compatible with
	Java 1.5 this time

Version 0.9.2
-------------

Initial version
	...on GIT
