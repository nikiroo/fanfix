1.1.4.RELEASE
=============
- Added ampersand (&) to the list of characters to be escaped in LEVEL 1 for JSON, JavaScript and CSS literals
  in order to make escaped code safe against code injection attacks in XHTML scenarios (browsers using XHTML
  processing mode) performed by means of including XHTML escape codes in literals.

1.1.3.RELEASE
=============
- Improved performance of String-based unescape methods for HTML, XML, JS, JSON and others when the
  text to be unescaped actually needs no unescaping.

=============
- Added support for stream-based (String-to-Writer and Reader-to-Writer) escape and unescape operations.

  of a complex conditional structure based on Character.isHighSurrogate(...) and Character.isLowSurrogate(...).
- [doc] Fixed description of MSExcel-compatible CSV files.
