/**
 * This package encloses the classes needed to use 
 * {@link be.nikiroo.utils.resources.Bundle}s
 * <p>
 * Those are basically a <tt>.properties</tt> resource linked to an enumeration
 * listing all the fields you can use. The classes can also be used to update
 * the linked <tt>.properties</tt> files (or export them, which is useful when
 * you work from a JAR file).
 * <p>
 * All those classes expect UTF-8 content only.
