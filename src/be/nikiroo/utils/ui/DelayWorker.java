/**
 * This class helps you delay some graphical actions and execute the most recent
 * ones when under contention.
 * <p>
 * How does it work?
 * <ul>
 * <li>it takes an ID and an associated {@link SwingWorker} and will call
 * {@link SwingWorker#execute()} after a small delay (see
 * {@link DelayWorker#DelayWorker(int)})</li>
 * <li>if a second call to {@link DelayWorker#delay(String, SwingWorker)} comes
 * with the same ID before the first one is done, it will be put on a waiting
 * queue</li>
 * <li>if a third call still with the same ID comes, its associated worker will
 * <b>replace</b> the one in the queue (only one worker per ID in the queue,
 * always the latest one)</li>
 * <li>when the first worker is done, it will check the waiting queue and
 * execute that latest worker if any</li>
 * </ul>
