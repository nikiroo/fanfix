# nikiroo-utils

## Version 5.0.0

- fix: Base64 implementation changed, no strange errors anymore
- fix: Downloader had some problems with POST redirection
- android: binary code (.class) is now bundled in the jar, too
- change: StringUtils.unzip64(String) now returns a byte[] (StringUtils.unzip64s(String) can be used instead)

- change: TestLauncher is now "silent" by default (no exception details, see setDetails(true))
